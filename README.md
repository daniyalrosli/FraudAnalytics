Bank Transaction Dataset for Fraud Detection (30%)

Project Overview :

This project, FraudShield, focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in bank transaction datasets. Using advanced machine learning techniques, the system aims to identify anomalies and patterns indicative of fraudulent activities, thereby enhancing financial security.

Features:

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing transaction patterns and identifying key features linked to fraud.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Implementing various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

- Fraud Detection Metrics: Using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.

-Deployment: Providing a user-friendly interface for real-time fraud detection.
